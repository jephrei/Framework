#Framework v0.1 alpha
This is a personal framework. Things will be ugly and/or [broken](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com). The final scope isn't fully realized yet, but I have my principles. I'll probably get distracted.

##Another framework?
Yes. It's an unorganized pile of foo but it's mine and I'm enjoying myself. You should make one too.

##Basics Ideas
* Consitency rather than resets
* Modular design for multiple use cases
* Semantic classes
* Less is more
* also trying to make zero top margins work in practice

##Key Features
###Implemented
* Includes normalize.css v3.0.0
* Border box model
* Responsive grid layout
* Basic element styles

###To Do
* Form Elements
* Split CSS to multiple files
 * base
 * grid
 * typography
 * button/form elements
 * colors
* Cross-browser testing

###Maybe
* Grid increments (like 4 columns for desktop and 2 for mobile)
* Color themes
* Icons
* Minimal animations
* Minified version
* Flexbox (when something more final is decided on)
* LESS (when/if my LESS knowledge gets better)

##Compatibility
I noticed that IE8 and below sucks but you probably knew that.
