#Framework v0.1 alpha
This is my personal framework and is a work in progress. The final scope isn't fully realized yet, but I'd like it to function well as a stepping stone yet be as minimal as posible. [We tend to break things](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com) and i want to try to avoid that.
This is in early development so things will be ugly and/or broken.

##Another framework?
Yes. It's an unorganized pile of foo but it's mine and I'm enjoying myself. You should make one too.

##Key Features
###Implemented
* Includes normalize.css v3.0.0
* Border box model
* Responsive grid layout
* Modular design
* Basic element styles

###To Do
* Form Elements
* Split CSS to multiple files
* Cross-browser testing

###Maybe
* Color themes
* Icons
* Minimal animations
* Flexbox (when something more final is decided on)
* LESS (when/if my LESS knowledge gets better)
* Minified version
* JS excuses - Things ya just can't do with CSS
 * Loading page
 * Other stuff i can't think of right now

##Compatibility
Browser compatibility hasn't been tested but it's likely to work with modern browsers. Things may get funky in IE 8 and below.

##Basic Principles
* less is more
* consitency rather than resets
* modular design for multiple use cases
* semantic classes

##Credits
* normalize.css http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
